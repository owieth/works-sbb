<h1>SBBgo @ SBB (2020 - 2021)</h1>

SBB always wants to improve customer satisfaction. With so many customers using our infrastructure every day, there are always a few things that stand out negatively. With SBBgo, customer management wants to fix these and thus improve customer satisfaction.  With SBBgo, selected customers and employees can join on a so-called study, in which the experience can be recorded with the help of the app at the specific place of execution. The data collected from the study participants can then be used to make targeted improvements to the culprits. 

Thanks to the collected journeys, we can see where a customer's SBB Journey begins, where it ends, which touchpoints play an important role in it, and how they are evaluated. The app enables us to get closer to the experiences and emotions of customers on their journey with SBB and to present them quantitatively or qualitatively.
